## Introduction

From December 2020 to January 2022, I volunteered to enhance Pyret’s chart library, 
a core component of a programming language designed for education. At the time, 
the library offered only basic functionality, limiting its ability to support 
data-driven education in programs like [Bootstrap World](https://www.bootstrapworld.org/). 
My goal was to dramatically expand its capabilities and flexibility, 
making it a more powerful tool for both educators and students.

## Implementation

To achieve this, I focused on porting and adapting as many features from the Google Charts library into Pyret as I could, while also introducing advanced customization options that extended beyond Google Charts’ original scope. 

Highlights include:
- Support for new chart types, such as stacked and grouped bar charts.
- Extensive customization features for colors, annotations, sorting, and scaling.
- Robust error handling to guide users and ensure reliable chart rendering.

Here’s a quick visual overview of the enhancements. To keep things brief I've kept this overview to the highlights:
