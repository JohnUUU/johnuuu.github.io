## Overview

In 2023, I developed **Weenix**, a fully functional, Unix-like operating system kernel, as part of a semester-long project for **CSCI1690: Operating Systems with Lab** at Brown University. This project involved designing and implementing core subsystems of an operating system, culminating in a kernel capable of managing processes, file systems, and virtual memory.

## Key Components

Weenix was built incrementally across several major subsystems, each focusing on a critical aspect of operating systems design:

1. **Processes and Threads (Procs)**
   - Implemented threading and process management, including context switching, scheduling, and synchronization primitives like mutexes.
   - Developed the initial process lifecycle, enabling multiple processes and threads to run concurrently in kernel mode.

2. **Device Drivers (Drivers)**
   - Created device drivers for character devices (e.g., terminals) and block devices (e.g., disks).
   - Supported memory devices like `/dev/null` and `/dev/zero` for efficient I/O operations.

3. **Virtual File System (VFS)**
   - Designed a UNIX-like file system interface to abstract file operations across different storage devices.
   - Implemented pathname resolution and system calls for opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

4. **System V File System (S5FS)**
   - Developed an on-disk file system with support for inodes, directories, and data blocks.
   - Implemented mechanisms for block allocation, directory traversal, and managing free lists.

5. **Virtual Memory (VM)**
   - Built a virtual memory manager to support user-space processes.
   - Handled page faults, demand paging, and memory-mapped files (e.g., `mmap` and `munmap`).
   - Implemented fork semantics with copy-on-write optimizations for efficient process duplication.

Although I cannot share the code publicly, I am happy to discuss this project in detail with potential employers. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in seeing my implementation or hearing more about my approach.
